I think a killer use case is just to leverage libraries written in Java from Go and viceversa. The java ecosystem is very rich in the open source as well as within corporations. Allowing people to run software in go(or java) without having to re-implement well tested libraries would be key feature for graalvm. This is specially true given go is gaining grounds as a backend language.``
